    <h1><center>Hello World!</center></h1>
    <h3><p>I'm Christopher Couch, your new junior software developer! (still in development...)</p></h3>
    <h3></h3>
    <h4><p>Before being initiated into the sacred art of computer code, my path through life is best described as diverse. As most people do, I tried my hand in
    a variety fields and professions since my teen years. I've been a soldier in the US Army, an insurance salesman, a financial advisor for middle class families,
    a barista at Starbucks, a lawn tech for a golf course, and worked stacking boxes of frozen food in a warehouse. However, nothing has given me a sense of being a 
    Jedi Master more than learning code. I truly do enjoy the mind meld of creativity and problem solving that engages my mind while coming up with solutions to user stories.</p></h4>
    <h3></h3>
    <h4><p>At home, I'm absolutely a family man. I love being a dad that provides opportunity and encouragement. I love being a husband that provides security and stability.
    Beth and I have been together for 3 years with our 6 children, and over the past year of the pandemic at home we've bonded even closer than ever. My perspective on
    what my role as dad and husband should be has solidified into modeling my actions after that of a king, being bound to the fate of his court and country. I could be
    the tyrant that demands my subjects bend to my needs and desires as their head-of-house. I could also be the lazy despot, living off my disability throught the VA and
    whining that life didn't hand me the life I wanted. But what draws me in are the Marcus Aurelius types; reflective, dutiful, stoic, honorable. Pushing myself through 
    a coding bootcamp without any coding or computer background, but with the mad drive of someone on a divinely inspired mission, has been made only that much more difficult
    by attempting it during the height of the pandemic.</p></h4>
    <h3></h3>
    <h4><p>With 7 weeks of classes still remaining for me at the time of this writing, I can see my skillset building and my proficiency getting sharper.  My hope and goals are 
    to join on with the likes of Tesla and Apple. I want to work for a group of forward thinkers that also hold ethics and humanity in high regard. I want to be creative. I want
    to be inspired. I want what I do to not only matter, but not work towards our own demise collectively. With these fingers, I will build worlds.</p></h4>
